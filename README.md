# JavaScript Unit Testing Adventure 🧪

Welcome to my JavaScript Unit Testing playground! This project is the result of my journey through the "JavaScript Unit Testing" course by Programming with Mosh on YouTube. It's packed with examples, exercises, and insights into the world of unit testing in JavaScript.

## 🚀 What's Inside

This repo is a treasure trove of unit testing goodness, covering:

- The basics of unit testing in JavaScript
- Setting up and using Vitest (because who doesn't love a speedy test runner?)
- Writing our first tests (spoiler: it's addictive)
- Tackling classic coding challenges with a test-driven approach
- Exploring Test-Driven Development (TDD) - where tests lead the way!

## 🎯 Key Concepts Covered

- Introduction to Unit Testing: What it is and why it's awesome
- Types of Tests: Because not all tests are created equal
- Choosing a Testing Framework: Spoiler alert - we're Team Vitest!
- Writing tests for real-world scenarios
- Test-Driven Development: Writing tests before code (it's not as scary as it sounds)

## 🧠 Challenges We Conquered

1. The Classic FizzBuzz: But this time, with tests!
2. Factorial Function: Making sure our math is on point
3. Average Calculator: Because averages are above average in importance

## 🛠️ How to Use This Repo

1. Clone it
2. Run `npm install` to get all the testing goodies
3. Execute `npm test` to watch the tests fly
4. Explore the code, tinker with the tests, and have fun!

## 🎓 What I Learned

This course was an eye-opener! I now understand the importance of writing tests, how to structure them effectively, and the joy of seeing all those green checkmarks. Test-Driven Development has changed how I approach coding problems, making me think more critically about edge cases and potential issues.

## 🚧 Next Steps

- Implement more complex testing scenarios
- Explore mocking and stubbing
- Integrate these testing practices into my personal projects

Remember, in the world of coding, untested code is guilty until proven innocent! 
Happy testing! 🎉
